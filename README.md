# palproxy
A Proxy Server for Palworld that sends webhooks when traffic starts and stops

# Background
This is a small project to relay traffic to a Palworld server.  This proxy
sends a webhook when traffic starts, and another after a configurable
timer after traffic stops.

The purpose of this proxy is to trigger the dynamic start/stop of a Palworld
server when users connect / disconnect.
